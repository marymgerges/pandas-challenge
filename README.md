## Summary of the Analysis


## Conclusions
Under the "Scores by School Spending" section, I noticed that the higher the spending ranges per student, the lower the percentage of overall passing, which is a little surprising.
In the "Scores by School Type" section, charter schools seem to do better in both math and reading than district schools, which seems logical.
